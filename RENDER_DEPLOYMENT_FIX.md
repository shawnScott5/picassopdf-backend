# 🚀 Render Deployment Fix for Playwright Issue

## 🎯 **The Problem**
Render's ephemeral filesystem causes Playwright browsers to disappear between build and runtime, leading to the error:
```
Executable doesn't exist at /opt/render/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-1187/chrome-linux/headless_shell
```

## ✅ **Solutions Applied**

### **1. Updated package.json Scripts**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm install && npx playwright install chromium",
    "postinstall": "npx playwright install chromium",
    "start": "node server.js"
  }
}
```

### **2. Enhanced Error Handling**
Added better error messages for browser installation issues in `ConversionsController.js`.

### **3. AWS Lambda as Primary Solution**
Your app is configured to use AWS Lambda as the primary PDF generation method, with Playwright as fallback.

## 🔧 **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Set Environment Variables on Render**
In your Render dashboard, add these environment variables:

```bash
# AWS Configuration (CRITICAL)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
AWS_REGION=us-east-2
LAMBDA_PDF_FUNCTION_NAME=picassopdf-converter

# Other existing variables
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
```

### **Step 2: Redeploy to Render**
1. Push your changes to Git
2. Render will automatically redeploy
3. The new build script will install Playwright browsers during build

### **Step 3: Test the Endpoint**
```bash
curl -X POST https://picassopdf-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/convert/pdf \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"html": "<h1>Hello from Render!</h1><p>Testing PDF conversion.</p>"}'
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

### **With AWS Lambda (Preferred):**
1. ✅ Request comes in
2. ✅ Lambda service checks availability
3. ✅ PDF generated via AWS Lambda
4. ✅ Response returned

### **With Playwright Fallback:**
1. ✅ Request comes in
2. ✅ Lambda service unavailable
3. ✅ Playwright browsers installed during build
4. ✅ PDF generated via Playwright
5. ✅ Response returned

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Lambda is not working:**
1. Check AWS credentials in Render dashboard
2. Verify Lambda function exists: `picassopdf-converter`
3. Check region: `us-east-2`

### **If Playwright still fails:**
1. Check Render build logs for browser installation
2. Verify `postinstall` script ran successfully
3. Check Render's disk space limits

### **Test Lambda Connection:**
```bash
# Add this to your Render environment variables temporarily
TEST_LAMBDA=true

# Then check logs for Lambda connection status
```

## 📊 **Performance Comparison**

| Method | Speed | Reliability | Cost |
|--------|-------|-------------|------|
| AWS Lambda | ⚡ Fast | 🟢 High | 💰 Pay-per-use |
| Playwright | 🐌 Slower | 🟡 Medium | 💸 Fixed cost |

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

- ✅ No "Executable doesn't exist" errors
- ✅ PDF generation works consistently
- ✅ Lambda service shows as available in logs
- ✅ Response times under 10 seconds

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy with updated scripts**
2. **Test production endpoint**
3. **Monitor Render logs for Lambda connection**
4. **Scale as needed** - Lambda handles concurrent requests automatically

Your deployment should now work reliably with both Lambda and Playwright fallback! 🚀
